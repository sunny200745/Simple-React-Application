## Introduction

## Software Requirements

- Install Git SCM https://git-scm.com/
- Install Node.js 6.11 or 8.9 LTS
- Install Visual Studio Code latest

## Get Started

To start with repository,

> git clone https://github.com/nodesense/react-workshop

> cd react-workshop

> npm install

> npm start

The above commands shall let you started. 

If you face command not found issue for git, you need to install it from https://git-scm.com/ or clone the repository and follow the above commands.

## API Server

Please follow instruction in https://github.com/nodesense/restful-server for setting up restful server needed for this workshop.


## NPM Introduction

Node Package Manager (npm) is installed along with Node.js installation. `npm` command helps to install packages from registry.npmjs.org website. `npm` command install packages on *node_modules* folder on the project directory.

## To create npm project,

> mkdir react-app

> cd react-app

below command creates default *package.json* in your current working directory *react-app*

> npm init -y

## install react packages

on npm 3.x, *--save* option helps to save the install package name in the package dependencies.

> npm install react react-dom prop-types --save

For React-Router,

> npm install react-router-dom --save

For redux,

> npm install redux react-redux redux-thunk --save

For RxJS,

> npm install rxjs --save

For jQuery

> npm install jquery --save

For Fetch (Ajax calls) polyfills

> npm install whatwg-fetch --save


For code splitting, split a modules that can be loaded separately 

> npm install react-loadable  --save

## Babel Setup

Babel is a transpiler, convert ES2016 (ES6), ES2016, ES2017, ES.NEXT to the ES5, the old JavaScript.

> npm install babel-preset-env babel-preset-stage-2 babel-preset-react --save-dev

Create the `.babelrc` in the project root directory

```
{
    "presets": ["env", "stage-2", "react"]
} 
```


Few more things with babel setup, when we need support for ES8 async/await keywords [to avoid  regeneratorRuntime issue]

> npm install --save babel-polyfill

Below lines must be added on top of main.js file.

```
import "babel-polyfill";
```
 
## Webpack setup

Webpack bundles many javascripts file into single js file, helps to load files faster in the browser. 

We use src/main.js as an entry file, all files imported within main.js and its sub-files are bundled into app.bundle.js, served from memory. 

> npm install webpack webpack-dev-server babel-core babel-loader --save-dev

Install below plug-ins to handle css entries specific to components on its relative path.

> npm install extract-text-webpack-plugin css-loader file-loader style-loader --save-dev

webpack config files are kept under src/config/webpack.config.js, src/config/webpack.prod.config.js

For production bundle, we need to copy the assets folders (copy-webpack-plugin), generate scripts and link tag dynamically based on hash code (html-webpack-plugin), clear the dist folder for every build (clean-webpack-plugin), For that, we need addtional plug-ins.


> npm install copy-webpack-plugin html-webpack-plugin clean-webpack-plugin --save-dev

## JEST

Jest is a test runner, uses jasmine for test description, comes with all packages pre-installed including test coverage. 

`__mocks__` is useful if you want to mock any files in the system, so that jest can import mock file rather than real project file.

> npm install jest babel-jest enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 react-test-renderer --save-dev

to run test cases,

> npm test

to run test cases with code coverage,

> npm run test-coverage

test cases to be stored in `__tests__` folder or stored with extenstion .spec.js or .test.js file in project directory. 


Please make sure that you have
